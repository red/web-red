    content: |-
      When we say "Full-Stack" we mean one common language base to code
      everything, from metal to meta. Platform-native GUIs, DSLs, code
      generators, device drivers, an OS...anything you can imagine.<br><br>
            
      With both a REPL and a self-contained toolchain, it's easy to get
      started. One file. Drop and go. It's also homoiconic, meaning Red
      is its own data format.<br><br>
        
      Red's Mission: Fight software complexity.

    heading: "How Red Stacks Up"
    content: |-
      Red's real superpower is the ability to bend and redefine the system
      to meet any need, improving readability and providing top-flight
      performance at the same time. This allows Red to extend its reach in
      both directions, down to the hardware and up through metaprogramming.

    heading: "Abstraction on Every Level"
    content: |-
      Red is more than just a language. It's a language construction set.
      Whether you’re writing a device driver, a platform-native GUI application,
      or a shared library, Red's flexibility lets you use a common syntax to
      code at the right level of abstraction for the task.<br>
      
      Some dialects (a.k.a. embedded DSLs) are already built in, to show you
      how it's done. There's one for writing GUIs, another for vector drawing,
      and a PEG-like parsing dialect. Even Red/System, the C level language
      is a dialect of Red.

    heading: "RED Tokens on the Blockchain"
    content: |-
      Coming in 2020, Red/C3 will be your new best friend on the blockchain
      for smart contracts and decentralized apps. It is being designed to 
      provide cross-chain smart contracts, just as Red is cross-platform for
      native apps. We hope to build a new economic model to better support
      open source project communities, which may be used later by other open
      source teams.<br>

      Red's domain-specific languages and ease of use make it a revolutionary
      new tool for the decentralized web. Stay tuned!

    heading: "Red Foundation Support"
    content: |-
      Funding Open Source work is hard, but Red has a non-profit foundation
      behind it to help. Contributors are compensated for their efforts today,
      and we'll do more in the future. There will be bounties for bugs, 
      documentation, testing, and even community support. Much of this will be
      facilitated through tokenomics on the blockchain. It's a brave new world.
